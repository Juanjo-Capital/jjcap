## Asset Class
- Fixed income?
- REITS?
- Based on what Chris said, we might be best off trading equities through Alpaca in a “quantamental” manner like how I described.

## Trading Architecture
- Mine Bloomberg for data (best stock data for consistency and time intervals) with Bloomberg terminals in the Comm School?
- Where do we mine our data?
- Models require data, and the data must be consistent 
- AWS to store the data? How and where should we store our data?
- We’ll encounter growing pains in the form of scaling issues.
- Hardware? Do we have a way to keep a PC running for 24hrs?
- Use a SQL database?

## Capital/Pay Structure
- Copy/paste Colonnade Capital operating agreement?
- Operate the fund during the summer? Or close the fund during the summer for the sake of compliance during internships?

## Responsibilities
- We all learn and work together initially to get things set up
- Specialize and carve out roles after we become more established

## Next Steps
- Dean will make a Slack for communication
- Shyon will try to inquire about Bloomberg terminal access (anyone else interested in this can check, too)
- Open Alpaca paper trading account
- Dean will send a When2Meet for a general body meeting time
- Dean will send operating agreement
