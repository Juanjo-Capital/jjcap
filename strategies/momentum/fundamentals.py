We will "filter" our universe of tech stocks further according to the following ratios:

1. Liquidity Ratios
    a. Quick Ratio = (cash + accounts receivable + short-term or marketable securities) / (current liabilities)
        i. 3.0 < x < 20.0

2. Financial Leverage Ratios
    a. Debt-to-Equity Ratio = (total debt) / (total equity)
        i. -0.1 < x < 0.2

3. Profitability Ratios
    a. Gross Profit Margin = (sales - COGS) / (sales)
        i. 0.5 < x
